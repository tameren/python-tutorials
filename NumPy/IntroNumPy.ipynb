    "## Why NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the most widely used package for scientific computing in Python. It provides a multidimensional array object and different derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), as well as a wide variety of ways to manipulate arrays. These include mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, and much more. NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the top benefits of using NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NumPy helps you reduce the loops and make your code clearer and easier to read.\n",
    "* NumPy uses algorithms written in C that complete in nanoseconds rather than seconds: all explicit looping, indexing, etc. is taking place \"behind the scenes\" in optimized, pre-compiled C code.\n",
    "* Operations on large datasets are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible with Python’s built-in sequences. Fewer lines of code generally mean fewer bugs.\n",
    "* A vast community is constantly working to keep NumPy fast, user-friendly, and bug-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous scientific and mathematical Python-based packages use NumPy arrays. This means that in order to work efficiently with most of today’s scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is already insufficient – one also needs to be familiar with NumPy arrays."
